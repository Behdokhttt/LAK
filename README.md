# Feedback Effects on Cognitive Dynamics
![Teaser](Study_Design.png)


This repository contains the codes for analyzing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) with EEG data and network-based methods.

The study investigates how feedback influences cognitive dynamics by combining EEG recordings and performance data. Participants completed the RMET while wearing a Muse EEG headband (channels: AF7, AF8, TP9, TP10). Two counterbalanced conditions were compared:

1)Feedback condition: participants received immediate feedback after each response.

2)No-feedback condition: no cue was provided.

We apply Neuro-Epistemic Network Analysis (NENA) and Neuro-Ordered Network Analysis (NONA) to examine how EEG frequency bands and task performance interact across these conditions. This repository includes scripts for EEG preprocessing, NENA, and NONA network generation.
